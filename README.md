# CS2-Terracotta
This was created in order to add Glazed Terracotta from vanilla 1.12 to Minecraft 1.6.4.

Setting up a 1.6.4 dev environment is not practical if even possible due to Gradle changes. I am using the Custom Stuff 2 mod by CubeX2 in order to achieve this.

This mod/config operates under the limitations of CS2 and therefore isn't super perfect.
All colors of Glazed Terracotta are added.
In order to change the orientation of the block you utilize a Stick and either left-click or right-click to turn it clockwise or counter-clockwise.
